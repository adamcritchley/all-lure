# Disclaimer
This board is still a prototype and is not functional. I do not recommend fabricating it yet...

# All-lure (GPIO, XDP, mPCIe, mSATA expansion for MinnowBoard)
All-lure is a custom "lure" expansion board for MinnowBoard Single Board Computers (SBC). The official hardware designs for MinnowBoard and the lures can be found at (MinnowBoards official GitHub)[https://github.com/MinnowBoard-org/design-files]. However, each board only exposes a single capability through the HSE (i.e. mSATA or mPCIe), instead I wanted a single board that combined as much of the lures capabilities into a single lure.

# Fabrication
I used JLCPCB with 1oz inner and outer copper weight and the standard JLC041611-7628 impedance control.
